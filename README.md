# TrikiMap
![Logo](https://github.com/SpinnyFinny/maps-wiki/blob/master/docs/images/triki-map-logo.png)

TrikiMap is a web app that allows users to collaboratively create maps which list multiple "points", for example, "Best micro-breweries in Vancouver", or "Best hiking spots". 

All maps are visible whether you are authorized user or not. When a an authorized user changes a map by adding, moving, updating or deleting a point, the user's profile changes so that he is identified as a contributor to the map. Authorized users can also favourite maps. 

The functional requirements, and their status can be found [here](https://github.com/SpinnyFinny/maps-wiki/blob/master/docs/Functional%20Requirements.md). 

Documentation can be found docs/index.html once you download the project.
